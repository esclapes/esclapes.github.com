Digital products like <em>eCards</em> and <em>Inspiring Gifts</em> became very important for UNICEF eCommerce in the early 2000. We designed and implemented these products from scratch, not only the <strong>purchase and personalization workflows</strong> but also <strong>CRM integration</strong>, in-house processes and collaboration with third party printing services. The store site has been rebuilt since then, but digital products are still based on the original design.
