During the years I spent at UNICEF, conversion optimization was a constant process. We went through several redesigns and implementations. In 2014 we started doing <strong>A/B testing</strong> on different layouts and contents to determine the best variations. Custom <strong>web analytics</strong> implementation was also required to evaluate the different acquisition channels. We also developed <strong>new web services</stong> to facilitate the process to recurring donors.
